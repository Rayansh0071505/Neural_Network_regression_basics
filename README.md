# Neural_Network_regression_basics
Its make for the better understanding of neural network for regression problem

There are many definitions for a regression problem but in our case, we're going to simplify it to be: predicting a number.

For example, you might want to:

<li>Predict the selling price of houses given information about them (such as number of rooms, size, number of bathrooms).
<li>Predict the coordinates of a bounding box of an item in an image.
<li>Predict the cost of medical insurance for an individual given their demographics (age, sex, gender, race).
<li>In this notebook, we're going to set the foundations for how you can take a sample of inputs (this is your data), build a neural network to discover patterns in     <u>those inputs and then make a prediction (in the form of a number) based on those inputs.
